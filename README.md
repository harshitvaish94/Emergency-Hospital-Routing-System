# Emergency-Hospital-Routing-System
A C-based Smart Hospital Network System that optimizes emergency patient admission using Data Structures and Algorithms. It models accident areas and hospitals as a graph, applies Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest routing, manages hospital beds using linked lists, and prioritizes critical patients with a priority queue.
